# About
 
This project was created as a tool to start on a new personal project. However in the process of development the Login Logic seemed to work very well and I ended up deciding to make it a personal template for my applications

# Inspiration
Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designersâ€™ intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.

~ Grady Booch, author of Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications

# Context

This is an authentication workflow that fits perfectly well with Rails Devise Authenthication. The idea can be used for any other Auth backend, because the logic wil almost always be relatively the same. 

# Technologies
1. React
2. Redux
3. Redux Sagas
4. Material UI. Inspired by [Google's Material UI Library](https://material-ui-next.com/)
5. Redux forms. Any front-end worth its salts needs to be inspired by revolutionary forms. You need to have good design, a way to manage state (In the case of React and Redux), and a neat way to do validations. [Redux Forms](https://redux-form.com/7.3.0/) sound like a smart idea.   
6. [AirBnB ESLint](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) *With some modifications*. Just because I am opinionated and wanted to think there is a right way to write code. 
7. [Redux Reset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-reset) Because Log out means getting the hell out. Don't leave data behind (in the state). 
8. [Axios http library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

No one is perfect, but it is a noble goal. Anyone wise, knows they know nothing, so I am always ready to learn better ways.
